# 2022 Heron field experiment

The project aimed to assess small population effects (Allee) on coral reproduction. Corals along a 125 m section of reef slope were georeferenced, sequenced, and monitored for spawning. Coral fertilisation was determined in such a way that we knew that 'dam' of each embryo but hoped to use parentage assignment to identify 'sires'.
